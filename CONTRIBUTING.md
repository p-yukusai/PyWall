# Contributing Guidelines
Everyone is welcome to contribute towards the development of PyWall, but for the sake of consistancy, simplicity and proper integration, some rules will be established.

## Issues
Like most other GitHub projects, you can always open an issue to report bugs and suggest features, it is favoured, but not required, that you attatch a simple tag to 
the title of the Issue to easily identify either, for instance tags such as [BUG] or [REQUEST].

### Use the latest version of the dev branch
When it comes to bug reports or feature requests should you always check that you're using the latest code available, the releases will not always catch up to the code, 
specially regarding the current [`dev`][dev] branch, so please keep that in mind.

### Check for duplicates
Please check if your issue or request has been stated already, otherwise it will be tagged as a duplicate and promptly discarded.

## Pull requests and code contributions
PR's are always welcome to further the development of this and all future projects, however, it is required that you make a list of all major changes that you have
made to the original code. <br />
All code contributed to the project will be licensed under the same license of said project. <br /> 
All pull requests should be made to the [`dev`][dev] branch, otherwise they may not be merged at the project manager's discretion.

## Code of Conduct
A [Code of Conduct] exists, it is in place to make everyone feel welcome in this project.  
If your contributions go against the Code of Conduct, it is very likely that they will be denied or reverted, and appropriate actions be taken.
